This is a test application. Work on this has started.

Basic Idea: 
this is a location app. i will be using this app to get the locations of my friends and family and then saving it in a database. 

Phase 2:
i will then output the locations using the google maps api.

Phase 3:
i will import the locations and the userdata from facebook, and people will no longer have to input the locations

Phase 4:
i will attach history to this app. hence all the locations that my friends and family have been to will be shown
